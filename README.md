# The A Team - Rayan, Tawfiq, Suha & Matt

## Section 1. Why?

This website is a short one-page team portfolio website aimed at a client looking to hire a team of developers. We were required to satisfy 7 user stories (see reference).

This project gave us experience of working with GitHUB in groups and an opportunity to practice our HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills.

## Section 2. What?

The website contains a header, a concise description of what we can offer and 3 main sections:

- **About** - An overview of our team and what we can offer
- **Team** - Information on each of our team members
- **Contact** - Contact us information including a form for users with JavaScript and a mailto: link for users without JS

## Section 3. How?

We began by reading the the project brief together and creating a list of all user requirements.

Next we devised a basic site structure together which half of the team built in HTML and the other half worked on our brand and website content.

Finally we broke into 2 teams, pair programming together, to solve clearly defined issues which we identified together in regular team catch-ups.
